# Frontend Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for frontend development:

## Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop validation (TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes)

## State Management
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use global state (Redux, Zustand, Context) for shared application state
- Avoid prop drilling - lift state up or use context

## Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for routes and components
- Use React.memo() or useMemo() for expensive calculations
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Implement proper image optimization

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Write meaningful component and function names
- Keep functions pure when possible
